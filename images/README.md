# Images

This directory contains all images used throughout the document. These images
can be used for both figures and as part of the fancy header.

The names will be prefixed with the [section](../sections/) number they are used
in, so they can easily be grouped or looked up by [section](../sections/).

For example, an image in section 1 would be prefixed with `01_`.
