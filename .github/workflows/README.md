# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains the GitHub workflows for this repository. Each workflow
and any supporting files will be documented here.

## [Build LaTeX](./build-latex.yml)

[build-latex.yml](./build-latex.yml) is a reusable workflow that can be used to
build a LaTeX document, and upload the resulting PDF as an artifact.

## [Build Release](./build-release.yml)

[build-release.yml](./build-release.yml) contains the main build workflow for
this repo. It will:

- Automatically generate a changelog and bump the version number, based on new
  conventional commits.
- Build the LaTeX document using [build-latex.yml](./build-latex.yml).
- Create a new Release on GitHub, uploading the document `.pdf` and changelog.

This will happen whenever any changes are pushed to `main`, which _should_ be
through PR's!

Note that the document name is derived from the repo name by default, and is
overridden by following line:

```yaml
DOCUMENT_BASE_NAME: Nathaniel_Struselis_CV
```

## [Fast Forward](./fast-forward.yml)

A workflow that allows using the `/fast-forward` command to complete a PR, and
merge it with the `git merge --ff-only` strategy. This is paired with the
[pull request](#pull-request) workflow.

GitHub's default "Rebase and Merge" strategy modifies the commits that it
rebases, which will negate things like GPG-signed commits. This workflow allows
a fast-forward merge to be performed instead.

This workflow is completely optional, and is only used to suit my preferred
`git` routine.

To use this workflow, you will need to either set up a
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
and add the token name to the following line of the workflow, or remove the
following line entirely:

```yaml
github_token: ${{ secrets.FF_PAT }}
```

Replacing `FF_PAT` with the name of your access token.

> [!TIP]
> Unless you use a
> [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens),
> this workflow will not be able to trigger other workflows when merging.

## [Lint Commits](./lint-commits.yml)

[lint-commits.yml](./lint-commits.yml) uses [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/)
to lint all commits in the repo with every PR, ensuring that they conform to the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)
specification.

The main [cliff.toml](../../cliff.toml) is used as the configuration file to
configure `git-cliff`, which should require conventional commits for this
workflow to function correctly.

## [Prep Build](./prep-build.yml)

[Prep Build](./prep-build.yml) is a reusable workflow that can be used to
prepare the variables used to build the LaTeX document, and prepare the
changelog and upload it as an artifact.

The prepared variables are:

- The CHANGELOG (both as an artifact and variable containing the contents)
- The versioned document name
- The bumped version number

## [Pull Request](./pull-request.yml)

This workflow simply monitors the commits in a PR, checks whether they can be
fast-forwarded, and generates a preview CHANGELOG and PDF file that are posted
as comments on the PR to allow review of the generated contents.

This is paired with the [fast forward](#fast-forward) workflow to close PRs
using the `git merge --ff-only` strategy.

The `check-fast-forward` job in this workflow is optional, and you can remove
this job along with the [fast forward](#fast-forward) workflow to use GitHub's
default merge strategies.
