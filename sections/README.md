# CV Sections

This directory contains the content for my CV. Each "section" represents a
different stage of my career, which usually corresponds to all experience with
an employer. Each section can have multiple experiences and title changes.

The addition of a section would represent a **major** version change.

These sections are all included in the [main.tex](../main.tex) file to compile
them into a single document.
